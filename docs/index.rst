Pydrofoil is an experimental emulator-generator for ISA models written in
`Sail`__. It can generate emulators for RISC-V__, ARM__, CHERIoT__ based on
their respective Sail models. The Pydrofoil-generated emulators achieve fast
performance by doing dynamic binary translation (aka just-in-time compilation)
from guest instructions into host machine instructions. It's built on top of
the `RPython meta-jit compiler`__ and reuses all its optimizations, backends,
etc. Performance is typically an order of magnitude better than the emulators
generated by Sail.

To get started with the RISC-V emulator, please consult :doc:`building_pydrofoil`.
