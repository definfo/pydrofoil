# Using Pydrofoil

## Testing compiled RISC-V executables

Pydrofoil accepts a compiled RISC-V executable and will run it. Typically, the
source code of the executable will test some RISC-V feature and report
success/failure. It should work on the same ELF files that the standard
Sail-based emulator also accepts. The following example commands should be
executed from a sail-riscv checkout.

```
./pydrofoil-riscv test/riscv-tests/rv64ui-p-addi.elf
```

which will print:

```
tohost located at 0x80001000
entrypoint 0x80000000
CSR mstatus <- 0x0000000A00000000 (input: 0x0000000000000000)
SUCCESS
Instructions: 259
Total time (s): 0.000712
Perf: 363.806007 Kips
```

A Pydrofoil binary contains an emulator for the 64-bit and for the 32-bit
variants of the RISC-V model. By default, the 64-bit emulator is used. To chose
the 32-bit emulator, you can use the `--rv32` commandline option:

```
./pydrofoil-riscv --rv32 test/riscv-tests/rv32ui-p-addi.elf
```

which prints:

```
tohost located at 0x80001000
entrypoint 0x80000000
CSR mstatus <- 0x00000000 (input: 0x00000000)
SUCCESS
Instructions: 256
Total time (s): 0.001858
Perf: 137.782859 Kips
```


## Booting Linux under Pydrofoil

This is an example of how to boot a Linux kernel using the Pydrofoil emulator:

```
./pydrofoil-riscv os-boot/rv64-linux-4.15.0-gcc-7.2.0-64mb.bbl -l 230000000

```

This command will run the Linux image that is part of the sail-riscv repo until
the login prompt. The instruction limit of 230 million
instructions is chosen such that booting proceeds until the login prompt.

You can try the equivalent command on the standard Sail emulator:

```
dtc < os-boot/rv64-64mb.dts > os-boot/rv64-64mb.dtb

./c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV64 --show-times -b os-boot/rv64-64mb.dtb \
    os-boot/rv64-linux-4.15.0-gcc-7.2.0-64mb.bbl -l 230000000 -V
```

The `dtb` file is a [device tree blob](https://www.devicetree.org/) that
describes the emulated hardware to the operating system, it gets generated from
a human-readable input file with the `dtc` command.  `dtc` is provided by `apt
install device-tree-compiler` on Ubuntu. Pydrofoil comes with its own `dtb` and
therefore doesn't need this argument.

Booting Linux is about 18 times faster with Pydrofoil  and uses about 8 times
the memory when compared to the Sail emulator on the two Ubuntu x86_64 machines
we tried:

| x86_64 machine | Pydrofoil | Sail emulator | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| laptop (i7-8565U) | 4min   | 75min      | 1:18.7  |
| Ryzen 9 3900X | 115sec | 34min36sec | 1:18.1 |
| <p style='text-align: right;'> RSS memory</p>   | 318MB  | 39MB       | 8:1 |


## Commandline Options

The `pydrofoil-riscv` binary accepts the following commandline options:

- `--rv32` run emulator in 32-bit mode (default: 64-bit)
- `-l/--inst-limit <limit>` stop execution after `limit` instructions (by
  default execution is only halted if a test is stopped via the htif device).
- `--instructions-per-tick <num>` tick the emulated clock every `num`
  instructions (default: 100).
- `-b/--device-tree-blob <file>` load dtb from `file` (but usually not needed)
- `--verbose` print a detailed trace of every instruction executed
- `--jit off` turn dynamic binary translation/JIT compilation off
- `--version` print the version of pydrofoil-riscv
