# Pydrofoil-RISC-V's Scripting API

**This is still a very experimental feature, we don't guarantee API stability
at this point.**

In order to make it easier to interact with a SAIL ISA model, we are working on
a scripting API using the [PyPy](https://pypy.org) Python interpreter. So far
this is only enabled for the RISC-V models (but can in principle also be added
for the other CPUs, given a small amount of effort).
